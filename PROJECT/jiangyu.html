                    I was born in Fujian, Xiamen, China. But I have no much memory about there. I come to Malaysia when I was young, so you can consider me as half of Malaysian. I don't have much impression about China, if you really want me to say, it's very crowded compared to Malaysia. My family in China was mostly farmers, so my hometown in my memory is burdened by hardships, left behind in technology, and mired in poverty. But it's different now since time has changed.

                <th>Greatest Achievement</th>
                <td>
                    Up to this point in my life, I have not achieved any remarkable accomplishments. However, perhaps the one experience I take the most pride in was a solo journey I undertook a few months ago. Strictly speaking, it was not exactly a leisure trip, but rather a necessary return to China due to visa issues. Nevertheless, I regarded it as a form of travel. I managed everything on my ownâ€”boarding planes, buses, and high-speed trainsâ€”accompanied only by music and the constant hum of surrounding crowds. Returning to China, my homeland, was both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. As is widely known, visa processing is not a quick matter, and thus the journey lasted for more than a month. During this period, I did not stay in my own home which is in Malaysia, nor was I in an environment I was accustomed to. To this day, I still wonder how I managed to endure that experience. In retrospect, I genuinely admire the resilience I demonstrated during that time, to me, I will consider it as a great achievement.

                   I could say myself is basically a Otaku as I always stay at home so I enjoy everything that can be done at home. Mostly I'm busy with assigngments and computer games such as Valorant and GTAV. I enjoy listen to any music but only when I'm driving.
